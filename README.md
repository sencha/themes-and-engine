# Ext JS Bridges Themes and Engine Generator
This repo contains documentation of the themes and engine npm package generation process.
These packages are used by the following products:
- ExtAngular
- ExtReact
- ExtWebComponents

## Step 1 - Acquire the latest version/branch of the SDK from https://support.sencha.com/

A commercially-stamped version of the SDK need to be used for the generation of the runtime package. This can be 
obtained from TeamCity continuous job or from the Sencha support portal (https://support.sencha.com/) as a commercial download.

Sign-in to https://support.sencha.com/ and download the latest ExtJS v7.4.0 SDK .zip file from Downloads and extract it.

**NOTE: Do not use the dev copy of ExtJS SDK from github, as it may lead to SDK version mismatch issue.**

**NOTE: this readme will refer to this folder as {sdkroot}**

**NOTE: If you wish a watermark to appear in the code, aquire a version of the SDK with the watermark.**

**TODO: need direction on how to acquire this: the trial download does not seem to have the watermark**


This initial version of themes-and-engine.js requires modifications to legacy slicing source code in the SDK and must be run locally,
by the developers / maintainers.

## Step 2 - edit first of 2 scss files

- cd to {sdkroot}/classic/theme-base/sass/etc/mixins
- edit: slicer.scss

edit this function: (see 2 comments)
//comment out this line
//add this line
```
@function sliceit($cls, $kind, $path, $extension) {
    $url: theme-background-image($path, $extension, true);

    @if $url != none {
        $op: $kind + ':' + $url;
        $slice: add-slice($cls, $op);
    }

//comment out this line
    //@return $url;
//add this line
    @return 'images/magnify.png';
}
```

## Step 3 - edit second of 2 scss files

- cd to {sdkroot}/classic/theme-base/sass/etc/mixins
- edit: slicer.scss

edit this mixin: (see 2 comments)
//comment out this line
//add this line
```
@mixin x-slicer($cls) {
    $cls: quote($cls);
    $slices: map_get($slicer-map, $cls);

    @if $slices != '' {
        // We don't need to use the $prefix for x-cmd-slicer and doing so would make it
        // difficult for Cmd to know what class to add...
        /*<if slicer>*/
        .x-cmd-slicer.#{$prefix}#{$cls}:before {
            display: none;
            // We need to override content when slicing:
//comment out this line
            //content: "x-slicer:#{$slices}" !important;
//add this line
            content: "" !important;
        }
        /*</if slicer>*/
// add a comment line to ensure the end directive gets its own line
        /* */
    }
}
```

## Step 4 - Create an app and copy ext folder

- With Sencha Cmd, generate a universal app (both classic and modern toolkits) with the latest release of the SDK (the one above that was just edited), for example:

```
sencha -sdk {sdkroot} generate app reference-app ./reference-app
```

- this command will create an 'ext' folder in the ./reference-app folder
- you can use this 'ext' folder created by this command for the next step

## Step 5 - add the premium packages to ./reference-app/ext/packages

- copy all premium package folders to ./reference-app/ext/packages

## Step 6 - replace the 'ext' folder for both modern and classic

- in ./modern folder of themes-and-engine
  - replace ./modern/ext with new SDK version ('ext' folder from above)

- in ./classic folder of themes-and-engine
  - replace ./classic/ext with new SDK version ('ext' folder from above)

## Step 7 - edit version property

- in ./template folder of themes-and-engine
  - replace version property in package.json.tpl

## Step 8 -  generate the packages

- run: npm install
- run: npm run allmodern
- run: npm run allclassic

When completed, the ./packages folder will have these 2 npm packages:

- ext-classic-runtime
- ext-modern-runtime

## Step 9 - Publish or link both of these packages

- run: ./packages/ext-modern-runtime/npm publish
- run: ./packages/ext-classic-runtime/npm publish

###or

- run: ./packages/ext-modern-runtime/npm link
- run: ./packages/ext-classic-runtime/npm link


## testing

- Angular must be tested with this version of Angular CLI
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/cli/v/9.1.12

to install this version of Angular CLI, use this command:

- npm i @angular/cli@9.1.12

there is a 'tests' folder in this repo

- with an Angular CLI ExtAngularClassic project
- test of a Pivot Grid
- test of all classic themes
  - aria
  - classic
  - crisp
  - crisp-touch
  - graphite
  - gray
  - neptune
  - neptune-touch
  - triton
